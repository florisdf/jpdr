description: "We remove the FPN and use a different box head for detection and recognition. Moreover, the feature map from which the RoI features are computed, can be chosen differently for the detection and recognition heads (with featmap_names_recog and featmap_names_detect). For this sweep, we investigate what happens when the recognition head is put on an earlier feature map. Because earlier feature maps have a smaller receptive field, we would expect less difference between the recognition performance on images inside a rack context and on images of cropped-out products."
